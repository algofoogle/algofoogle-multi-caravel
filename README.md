This [caravel_user_project] is a submission for GFMPW-1 using the Global Foundries GF180 Open PDK (gf180mcuD) from Google.

**The aim is to create a submission combining multiple projects from different contributors, as well as some competing implementations of the same design for testing/characterisation.**

# Included projects in this submission

## raybox-zero

This repo was created as a result of studying the [Zero to ASIC Course]. It wraps [raybox-zero] (its `gf180` branch). **This design implements a simple hardware ray caster** and it is hardened as its own GDS macro of approximately 1mm x 1mm. It also makes extensive use of Logic Analyzer pins.

**More to come!**
